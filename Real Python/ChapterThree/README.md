There are two main windows that you will work with in IDLE: the <strong>interactive window</strong>, which is the one that opens when you start IDLE, and the <strong>script window</strong>
<br>
### The Interactive Window
The interactive window contains a <b>Python shell</b>, which is a textual user interface used to interact with the Python language. Hence the name “<I>interactive window.</I>”
<br>

The sequence of events in the interactive window can be described as a loop with three steps:
-  First, Python reads the code entered at the prompt.
- Then the code is evaluated.
-  Finally, the output is printed in the window and a new prompt is displayed.
<br>
This loop is commonly referred to as a <b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>valuate-<b>P</b>rint <b>L</b>oop, or <b>REPL</b>. Python programmers sometimes refer the Python shell as a “<i>Python REPL</i>”, or just “<i>the REPL</i>” for short.
 <br>
 <br>
A <b>function</b> is a bit of code that typically takes some input, called an <b><i>arrgument</i></b>, does something with that input, and produces some output, called the <b><i>return value</i></b>.

### The Script Window
Used for writing Python scripts that have <b>multiple lines</b> of code as the Interactive window limits the programmer to only <b>1 line</b>, hence why you create new files called <b><i>Script Files</i></b>
<br>

 There are <b>Two</b> main types of Errors in programming: <b><i>Syntax errors </i></b> and <b><i>Run-time errors</i></b>
 #### Syntax Errors
A <b><i>Syntax Error</i></b> occurs when you write some code that isn't allowed in the Python Language
 E.g. <i>print("Hello,World)</i>
</p>
<p><b>EOL</b> stands for <b>E</b>end <b>O</b>f <b>L</b>ine</p>
<p>
 
 #### Run-time Errors
 IDLE catches syntax errors before a program starts running, but some errors can’t be caught until a program is executed. These errors are known as <b><i>run-time errors</i></b> because they only occur at the time that a program is run.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Variables</b> are names that can be assigned a value and used to reference that value throughout your code.
 <br>
 
 - Variables keep values accessible <br>
 - Variables give values context
</p>

#### Rules For Valid Variable Names
Variable names can be as long or as short as you like, but there are a couple of rules that youmustfollow. Variable names can only contain uppercase and lowercase letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and underscores (_). However, variable names cannot begin with a digit.

<p><b>Unicode</b> is a standard for digitally representing text used in most of the world's writing systems.</p>
<p>
 
 #### Comments
 Single line comments start with # while a multiline comments has """ Comment """ <br>
 - Comments that start on a new line are called <b>block comments</b> & Comments that appear in the same line as some code are called <b>in-line comments</b>

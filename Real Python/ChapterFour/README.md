<h1><u><i>Strings and String Methods</i></u></h1>
<p>
- <b><i>Strings</i></b> are a collection of texts. <br>
- <b><i>String Methods</i></b> are special functions used to manipulate strings <br>
- <b><i>Data Type</i></b> refers to what kind of data a value represents <br>
- Strings are a <b><i>Fundamental</i></b> data type because they cannot be broken down into smaller values of different type.<br>
- <b><i><u>Compound Data Types</u></i></b> are also known as <b><i>Data Structures</i></b>

<p>
  <h4><b>3 Main Properties of a string</b></h4>
- String contain <b>Characters</b> - Which are individual letters and symbols <br>
- strings have <b>Length</b> - which is the numbers of characters contained in a string <br>
- Characters in a string appear in a <b>Sequence</b> - which means each character has a numbered position in the string
</p>
<p>
 - Whenever you create a string by surrounding texts with quotation marks, the string is called a <b>String Literal</b> <br>
- The Quotes surrounding the string are called <b>Delimiters</b>
- <b>Docstrings</b> are triple-quoted strings that are used to document code
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Concatination, Indexing & Slicing Strings</h4>
  - <b>Concatination</b> - Joins two strings together <br>
  - <b>Indexing</b> - Gets a single character from a string <br>
  -<b>Index</b> - Is the numbered position of a character in a string <br>
  - <b>Slicing</b> - Gets sveral characters from a string at once <br>
  - Strings are <b>Immutable</b> - You can't change them once you've created them
</p>

<p>
  <h4>String Methods(NOT ALL)</h4>
  <b>.lower()</b> and <b>.upper()</b> - To change the cases <br>
  <b>.rstrip()</b>, <b>.lstrip()</b> and <b>.strip()</b> - To remove white spaces <br>
  <b>.startswith()</b> and <b>.endswith()</b> - To check if a string starts with or ends with a particular string <b>It's case-sensitive</b>
  
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Strings and Numbers</h4>
  - A <b>Sequence</b> is any python object that supports accessing elements by index <br>
  - There are two ways of changing strings to number Type <b>int()</b> and <b>float()</b> <br>
  - Use <b>str()</b> to change a number to a string

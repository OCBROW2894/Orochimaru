* Use re.split() for Advanced String Splitting
 Hereâ€™s a list of the regex constructs that you used to make this split happen:

\s: Matches any whitespace character.
*: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding.
(?:): Creates an alternation group, for example (?:abc|def), that matches any of the patterns abc or def in their entirety. In your specific example, this allows you to treat AND as a single delimiter to split on.
[]: Creates a character set that matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets.
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding.

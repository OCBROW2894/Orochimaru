- There are two main windows that you will work with in IDLE: the <strong>interactive window</strong>, which is the one that opens when you start IDLE, and the <strong>script window</strong>
<br>
<h3>The Interactive Window</h3>
The interactive window contains a <b>Python shell</b>, which is a textual user interface used to interact with the Python language. Hence the name “<I>interactive window.</I>”
<br>

The sequence of events in the interactive window can be described as a loop with three steps:
-  First, Python reads the code entered at the prompt.
- Then the code is evaluated.
-  Finally, the output is printed in the window and a new prompt is displayed.
<br>
This loop is commonly referred to as a <b>R</b>ead-<b>E</b>valuate-<b>P</b>rint <b>L</b>oop, or <b>REPL</b>. Python programmers sometimes refer the Python shell as a “<i>Python REPL</i>”, or just “<i>the REPL</i>” for short.
 <br>
 <br>
A <b>function</b> is a bit of code that typically takes some input, called an <b><i>arrgument</i></b>, does something with that input, and produces some output, called the <b><i>return value</i></b>.

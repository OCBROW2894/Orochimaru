<h1>Numbers and Math</h1>
- <b><i>Exponetial Notation</i>(E-Notation)</b> - is the more common name for how many calculators and programming languages display large numbers. <b><i>E.g.</i> 1e6 for a float 1 million ( 1×10⁶) </b> <br>
- <b><i>2e+17</i></b> - The + sign indicates that the exponent 17 is a positive number. <br>
- The literal <b><i>1e-4</i></b> is interpreted as 10 raised to the power-4, which is 1/10000 or, equivalently, 0.0001.

<h1>Finding & Fixing Code Bugsüêõ</h1>
- <b><i>Logic errors</i></b> - Occur when an otherwise valid program doesn't do what is intended. E.g. <b> 1+1=25</b>

  <h4>The STEP Button</h4>
  - You can probably imagine how beneficial this feature is when trying to locate the source of bugs in your programs. Knowing each variables value at each line of code can help you pinpoint where things go wrong.
  <h4>Breakpoints and the "Go" Button</h4>
  - <b><i>Breakpoint</i></b> - Breakpoints tell the debugger when to pause code execution so that you can take a look at the current state of the program. They don‚Äôt actually break anything. <br>
  - Each time you press the <b><i>Go</i></b> button, the debugger runs the code continuously until the next breakpoint is reached. 

<h4>"Over" and "Out"</h4>
- The <b><i>Over</i></b> button works as sort of a combination of Go . It steps over a function or loop. In other words, if you‚Äôre about to Step and Step into a function with the debugger,you can still run that function‚Äôs code without having to Step all the way through each line of it. The Over button takes you directly to the result of running that function. <br>
- Likewise, if you‚Äôre already inside of a function orloop, the <b><i>Out</i></b> button executes the remaining code inside the function or loop body and then pauses.

 - The process of re-writing existing code to be cleaner, easier to read and understand, or adhere to code standards set by a team is called <b><i>Refactoring</i></b>.

<b>NOTE:</b> <i>One way to get some practice is to open the Debug Control Window
 and use it to step through your code as you work on the exercises and
 challenges throughout the rest of </i>
